my college team is data team they are horizontal who works in bringing the master or reference or transactional data from sources outside our division and distribute it with our division. so we are horizontal team. They have team with full of informatica developers who create etl process to do all these tasks for multiple squads.. example one squad would ask to bring data ...and load into another analytics server hdfs. server.. we have hdfs server these guys are involved in loading data into hdfs server as well we have internal tool called cdl which is responsible to load data into hdfs.. so some guys ask this team to load data from their datamart database to hdfs. so they guys does that work as well. thier team is datamart has db2 database.. and they are also responsbile to load data into hdfs as well.. so if you seee whole tasks of team everything is backend nothing as ui to present our tasks. because all are scheduled jobs .. this make them less visible .. the amount of work they do is more but still they are less known or highlighted. so i thought of creating one application called platformview.  Which completely shows the what the team is currently doing something like dashboard but wanted to make as application. Here we can see what are the teams we are actively working to bring data, how data loaded in last 1 week or 1 day.. how tables newly created how many deployments happened, how many jiras worked on, how many production issues/hygiene issues., more(i just wrote what i had in my mind but i need you to give me more). my aim is it should be full view of works we do.. not just jira board, or observability it should show information in all areas which people can understand easily what is happening with data team. di did you udnertand till now? what i am asking for? i will provide some more information
ChatGPT said:
Yes, Prasanth, I understand clearly what you're aiming to do.

You’re planning to build an internal application called "PlatformView" that acts as a central visibility hub for your horizontal data team. This app will highlight all the backend work your team does — especially the ETL, data ingestion into HDFS, CDL jobs, DB2 datamart loads, and more — so that others across the organization (like product owners, squad leads, or management) can see and appreciate the team’s contributions, which are currently invisible due to the absence of a UI layer.

You’ve already listed important metrics like:

Teams you're working with

Recent data loads (daily/weekly)

Newly created tables

Deployment counts

Jira tickets worked on

Production/hygiene issues

Your goal is to go beyond traditional Jira boards or observability dashboards and create a complete, understandable, and real-time view of your team’s data platform work.

✅ Yes — I fully understand the purpose and scope. Now, before you provide more, here's what I suggest adding to PlatformView, so it's truly comprehensive and useful:

🔍 Additional Views & Features for PlatformView

You said:
see i dont want to make it more observability bases as well because i want it for business .. some information is fine but not everything.  also how to get data loaded for that application is manual if we add more like observability piece it will become difficult.
example i think some information we can ask or crate some screen to add it .. in that case we cannot expect people to enter more information right so that is also limited. moreover that is future goal. now intention is to bring the data .. alter we can think of automation of data load. but still i mean i should not have have processor to load data.. example jira board integration is fine, some metadata integration is fine, some observability integration is also fine and some screen we can create to enter some important data.  but if it has more integration on data loading piece then it will big project.. my intention is to have good light weightedkind of application which replicaties the work data team does
ChatGPT said:
Perfect, Prasanth — thanks for the clarification.

You're envisioning a lightweight, business-facing application that summarizes the work of your data team, without becoming a full-blown observability platform or an engineering-heavy solution. The goal is to make your team’s effort visible and appreciated, using a mix of automated integrations (where easy), light manual entries, and smart visualizations.

Let me reframe and structure the PlatformView app plan accordingly 👇

✅ Purpose
To provide a business-friendly, high-level view of the work done by the data team (integration, ingestion, support), highlighting efforts across multiple squads, tools, and data systems — with minimal automation, using light integrations and manual inputs.

🧩 PlatformView — Modular Design
1. 📦 Work Intake Tracker
Purpose: Show which squads have raised requests to the data team.

Inputs:

Manual entry or form (Squad Name, Source, Target, Start Date, Status)

Optional: Auto-sync with Jira if project board exists.

2. 📅 Weekly Highlights
Purpose: Provide a snapshot of work done this week.

Auto/Manual Inputs:

of new tables loaded ✅ (manual input from team)
of deployments done ✅
of issues resolved ✅
of jobs created ✅
of new source systems integrated ✅
UI: Simple dashboard cards with counters + “Last updated on” timestamp

3. 📈 Squad Engagement View
Purpose: Visualize which squads you are helping and how often.

Input:

Manual or basic CSV (Squad Name, Request Type, Source DB, Target)

UI:

Heatmap or table showing squad vs. activities

4. 📊 Data Flow Overview
Purpose: Let others understand “what flows where” (business-friendly)

Input:

Metadata manually entered (source -> target mapping)

CDL jobs (job name, source, target, refresh freq)

UI:

Visual “Source ➝ Transformation ➝ HDFS” flowchart per request

5. 🛠️ Deployment Tracker
Purpose: Show which jobs/pipelines were deployed

Input:

Manual entry or Jira label (e.g., deployment)

UI:

Timeline or tabular view of deployments with links (if stored in Git, Jira)

6. 🧾 Issue & Hygiene Log
Purpose: Show production/hygiene efforts (often invisible but important)

Input:

Manual form with tags (e.g., “refresh issue”, “schema change”, etc.)

Optional: Basic alert logs from CDL/HDFS (lightweight parsing)

UI:

Filterable list with tags and dates

7. 🧠 Insights/Impact
Purpose: Communicate value to business

Examples:

Total data volume moved (optional, if easy to fetch)

of external systems onboarded
% of team effort per squad (just pie chart based on counts)

🔌 Data Input Strategy
Source	Type	Mode
Jira	Tickets	Auto fetch via API
Team	Work summary, deployments	Simple web form
Metadata	Source-target mappings	Upload CSV or manual entry
CDL / HDFS	Light status logs	Optional / future scope
🎨 Tech Stack Suggestion
Frontend: React or Streamlit (if internal only)

Backend: Lightweight API (Flask/FastAPI)

Storage: SQLite or PostgreSQL

Hosting: Internal VM / Azure Web App (if applicable)

🛠️ Later (Future Scope)
Auto-fetch CDL job runs

Metadata from HDFS

Auto alerts on failure logs

Notifications to squads

Role-based access control

we have react we have db2 dbatabase we have application infrastructe everything ready just we need tos tart development.. but before that tell me is it good? is it worth?  or any suggestions.
ChatGPT said:
Prasanth — based on everything you shared, yes, it is absolutely worth building PlatformView. Here’s a breakdown of why it’s a smart and strategic move, followed by a few fine-tuned suggestions to make it successful without overcomplicating it.

✅ Why PlatformView Is a Good Idea
1. Solves a Visibility Problem
Your data team is a backbone/horizontal enabler — but backend jobs, pipelines, CDL loads, and HDFS ingestion are invisible to non-technical stakeholders.

This app acts like a “glass window” into your team's efforts — easy for product owners, managers, and squads to see the impact.

2. Lightweight But Valuable
You’re not building a heavy observability or monitoring system.

You’re leveraging existing Jira, manual inputs, and metadata — so it's manageable, not overkill.

And you're using React + DB2, which fits well for internal apps and avoids unnecessary tech sprawl.

3. Boosts Recognition
The app gives your team internal branding — people and leadership will start to associate the data team with impact, not just silent jobs running at 2 AM.

Helps during performance reviews, budget asks, or cross-team collaboration.

4. Future-Proof and Extensible
You're starting small: mostly metadata, forms, counters, integrations.

But later, you can add automation, charts, cost metrics, or access logs — making it more valuable without redoing anything.

💡 Smart Suggestions to Keep It Focused and Successful
🔹1. Don’t Boil the Ocean
Start with:

Squad requests

Work done (weekly/monthly)

Jira tickets

Simple source-target metadata

Deployment log

Minimal dashboard

Avoid:

Real-time logs

Too many backend integrations

Deep observability or alerting

These can come later only if the team has bandwidth.

🔹2. Highlight Value Metrics Over Tech Terms
Instead of “CDL Job #42 ran in 200s”, show:

✅ Loaded 3 tables from DB2 to HDFS for Squad X – Delivered before sprint end

Business users don’t care about tool names — they care about outcome.

🔹3. Keep Data Entry Easy
Keep manual forms short, quick, and guided (e.g., dropdowns for squads, sources, request types)

You could build CSV upload templates for bulk inputs (metadata or weekly summaries)

Optional: internal API for team members to submit from a script (later stage)

🔹4. Involve the Team Early
Show your team an early mock/demo (even a Figma or clickable prototype)

Let them vote on what metrics they’d like to track or what burdens them the most to report

They’ll support it more if they see it reduces email reporting or manual status updates

💬 Final Verdict
🎯 PlatformView is an excellent and high-impact internal product.

It:

Elevates your team’s visibility

Keeps the app lightweight and business-focused

Can grow gradually

Works well with your existing tech (React + DB2)

If you'd like, I can now:

Draft your Phase 1 module plan

Help with schema design

Suggest form layouts or UI page flow

What would you like next?
